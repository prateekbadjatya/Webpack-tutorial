//HTMLWebpackPlugin: 

// HTMLWebpackPlugin accepts two important arguments for the task at hand.
// The first is chunks, which accepts what chunks to add to the HTML file.
// The second is filename â€“ which will define the name of the HTML file.

//CleanWebpackPlugin

// use the clean plugin to delete the dist folder before a build
